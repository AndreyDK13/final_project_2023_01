# TASK

We need to create a program that should filter out an array of strings where there are only elements containing a maximum of 3 symbols and show it on the screen

For example:

Input Array
[abc, def, ghijk, lmnop, qrstuvw]

Filtered Array:
[abc, def]

## Algoritm

If we want to have a result such the example, we must to create the array in square brackets, which get only the elements with maximum 3 symbols

### Step 0

For the more scaling issue we input more variables:

* The number of array elemets
* The maximum count of symbols in array elements

And create the methods for input this variables and the elements of array

### Step 1

We will find the number of elements, which have 3 symbols or less

### Step 2

We create new array, which will get only elements from step 1

### Step 3

We return the filtered array on the screen in square brackets
